# Shoscan

Messing around and experimenting with the Shodan API. 

- https://developer.shodan.io/

## Details

- Intended to be used as a command line tool
- Scan files on your system containing ip(s) or subnet(s)
- Easily add/remove keys within the script (i'll add some flags and improve on this later)
- Be cautious about your query credits :) (unless you've got unlimited)

## Future

- Adding some additional network scanning and comparing findings
- git stuff
